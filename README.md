This repository stores scripts for data collection and analysis of the Geneva Graduate Institute's theses, dissertations, and courses.

It was created within the framework of the Sustainability Target Initiative of the Geneva Graduate Institute. 

The mission of this initiative is to integrate considerations of sustainability into all areas of work at the Institute - as research questions, objects of teaching, and projects of engagement in our daily lives, in Geneva and  the world.
